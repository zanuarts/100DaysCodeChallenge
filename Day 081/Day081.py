def make_negative( number ):
    if number < 0:
        return number
    return number*-1

# In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

# Example:

# make_negative(1);  # return -1
# make_negative(-5); # return -5
# make_negative(0);  # return 0
# Notes:

# The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
# Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
